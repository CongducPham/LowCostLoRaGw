Using Node-Red
==============

This README describes a simple Node-Red support for our low-cost LoRa gateway. It can be improved in many ways, according to your needs. The current implementation comes with a Node-Red flow that takes the received messages from the gateway, through a file created by a Node-Red dedicated cloud script, to publish data on a topic.


Starting Node-Red on you Raspberry gateway
------------------------------------------

The SD card image has Node-Red installed. You can manually start Node-Red with

	> node-red-start
	
Use your browser on `http://192.168.2.8:1880` for instance if this is your gateway's IP address. Make sure that your gateway has internet connection.

If the Node-Red cloud (`CloudNodeRed.py`) is enabled in `clouds.json` then Node-Red will be started by the `start_gw.sh` script. So you do no need to worry about starting manually Node-Red (and you should not start it manually actually).

In the case you use Node-Red for other purposes than `CloudNodeRed.py` (the cloud is disabled), then you can enable Node-Red at boot with:

	> sudo systemctl enable nodered.service

But be sure that this is what you want because having Node-Red running is resource-consuming. If you just want to test, just use the `node-red-start` command. You can disable the service at any time with:

	> sudo systemctl disable nodered.service	

Importing the Node-Red flow
---------------------------

This is the flow that you can import (copy and then Import/Clipboard):

Principles
----------

`CloudNodeRed.py` will be called by `post-processing-gw.py` if a Node-Red cloud is enabled in `clouds.json`:

	{	
		"name":"NodeRed flow",
		"script":"python CloudNodeRed.py",
		"type":"nodered",			
		"enabled":true
	}
		
Additionally, `key_NodeRed.py` will define `project_name`, `organization_name` and `sensor_name` that will be used to build the full sensor name. For instance, with:

	project_name="waziup"
	organization_name="UPPA"
	sensor_name="Sensor"

then, when device 2 sends "TC/22.5/HU/85" to the gateway, `CloudNodeRed.py` will generate the following json entries in `nodered/nodered.txt` file:

	{"source":"waziup/UPPA/Sensor2","measure":"TC","value":22.5}
	{"source":"waziup/UPPA/Sensor2","measure":"HU","value":85}	
	
The Node-Red flow is composed of a tail node that follows the `nodered/nodered.txt` file for new entries. Each entry will be converted into a json object with a json node. A function node will use the json entry to build a message as follows:

	if (msg.payload.measure==="")
		msg.topic=msg.payload.source
	else
		msg.topic=msg.payload.source+'/'+msg.payload.measure
	msg.payload=msg.payload.value
	return msg; 		

Note the test `if (msg.payload.measure==="")` that allow encrypted payload to be passed without trying to append a measure nomenclature (such as TC for instance). Finally, there are 2 MQTT nodes, one using the `test.mosquitto.org` broker and the other one using the `broker.mqttdashboard.com` broker. The advantage of the latter is to also provide a web interface at `http://www.hivemq.com/demos/websocket-client/` for publishing and subscribing. These brokers will receive the messages with the topic defined as `waziup/UPPA/Sensor2/TC` and `waziup/UPPA/Sensor2/HU`, and will then respectively publish 22.5 and 85 under these topics. The default topic is then project\_name+"/"+organization\_name+"/"+sensor\_name+sensor\_address+"/"+measure\_name. You can change the function if you want to build a different topic.	

There is also a ThingSpeak node sending to our LoRa test channel (https://thingspeak.com/channels/66794). The ThingSpeak node can be installed with:

	> npm install node-red-contrib-thingspeak42

You may need to have npm installed beforehand:

	> sudo apt-get install npm
	
More info on the ThingSpeak node can be found at [https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-thingspeak42](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-thingspeak42). The ThingSpeak node waits for the `waziup/UPPA/Sensor6/TC` topic to upload the data on field 5.
 
 
Testing with test.mosquitto.org
===============================

First, install the mosquitto client software:

	sudo apt-get install mosquitto-clients
	
If you want to install the full package including the `mosquitto` MQTT broker and python lib, then:

	> sudo apt-get install mosquitto mosquitto-clients python-mosquitto 
	
But if you just want to enable MQTT client, it is advise to just have the mosquitto-clients package.	

	
Subscribing to a sensor
-----------------------

In a terminal, run:

	mosquitto_sub -v -h test.mosquitto.org -t 'waziup/UPPA/Sensor2/#'
	
or 

	mosquitto_sub -v -h broker.mqttdashboard.com -i testclient -t 'waziup/UPPA/Sensor2/#'	
	
You can of course subscribe to only one topic if you want:

	mosquitto_sub -v -h test.mosquitto.org -t 'waziup/UPPA/Sensor2/TC'		
	

Publishing with mosquitto_pub to test
-------------------------------------

In a terminal, run:

	mosquitto_pub -h test.mosquitto.org -t 'waziup/UPPA/Sensor2/TC' -m 22.5	
	
Publishing with http://www.hivemq.com/demos/websocket-client/ to test
---------------------------------------------------------------------

In a browser, connect to `http://www.hivemq.com/demos/websocket-client/`, then connect to the server and use the publish tab to indicate the topic under which you want to publish and the message you want to publish.
	
	
Emulating sensor data
---------------------

With Node-Red started and the flow loaded and deployed with the web browser, use `echo` or `printf` in a terminal to write into the `nodered/nodered.txt`file:

	printf '{"source":"waziup/UPPA/Sensor2","measure":"TC","value":22.5}\n{"source":"waziup/UPPA/Sensor2","measure":"HU","value":85}\n' >> nodered/nodered.txt
	
You should see in the web browser debug information indicating that new data has been processed by the flow and, most importantly, in the terminal where you subscribed to the `waziup/UPPA/Sensor2/# topics, you should see:

	waziup/UPPA/Sensor2/TC 22.5
	waziup/UPPA/Sensor2/HU 85
	
If you want to test the ThingSpeak node:

	printf '{"source":"waziup/UPPA/Sensor6","measure":"TC","value":22.5}\n' >> nodered/nodered.txt	
	
	
Running the gateway with Node-Red cloud enabled
-----------------------------------------------

- enable `CloudNodeRed.py` in `clouds.json`
- start Node-Red on your gateway if needed: `node-red-start`	
- import the flow and deploy it
- use the simple temperature sensor to send data to the gateway: `TC/22.5` for instance
- use the gateway or another computer to subscribe to the topic: `waziup/UPPA/Sensor2/TC` for instance, depending on the address of your sensor node and your `key_NodeRed.py` configuration


Simply publish to an MQTT topic with the gateway
------------------------------------------------

Of course, it is very simple to simply publish to an MQTT topic directly with the gateway. Look at the `CloudMQTT.py` cloud script that again uses the `test.mosquitto.org` broker. `key_MQTT.py` defines variables that will be used by `CloudMQTT.py` to build the MQTT topic.
	
Enjoy!
