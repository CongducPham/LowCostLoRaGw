Train,
timestamp,Time of recording in yyyy-mmm-dd hh-mm-ss
Soil_humidity_1,Soil humidity of field 1
Plot_1_irrigation,"1=irrigation on, 2=irrigation off"
Soil_humidity_2,Soil humidity of field 2
Plot_2_irrigation,"1=irrigation on, 2=irrigation off"
Soil_humidity_3,Soil humidity of field 3
Plot_3_irrigation,"1=irrigation on, 2=irrigation off"
Soil_humidity_4,Soil humidity of field 4
Plot_4_irrigation,"1=irrigation on, 2=irrigation off"
Air_temperature,Temprature of the air in degrees Celcius
Air_humidity,Humidity of the air
Air_Pressure,Pressure of the air in kilo pascals
Wind_speed,Speed of the wind in kilometers per hour
Wind_gust,Speed of the gusts of wind in kilometers per hour
Wind_irection,Direction of the wind in degrees from North
,
Context,
Date,Date (MM/DD/YYYY)
Min_Temp,"Minimum daily temperature measured in celsius
"
Max_Temp,"Maximum daily temperature measured in celsius
"
Humidity,Percent air humidity
Wind_Speed,Wind speed measured in meters per second
Solar_Irradiance,"The power per unit area (Watt per square metre, W/m2), received from the Sun in the form of electromagnetic radiation as reported in the wavelength range of the measuring instrument."
Sun,Radiant energy emitted by the sun measured in Mega Jouls per day
Kc,Crop coefficient Kc. A property of plants used in predicting evapotranspiration (ET). Evapotranspiration is the process by which water is transferred from the land to the atmosphere through evaporation and plant transpiration. Kc is the most basic crop coefficient calculated as ETc / ETo
ETc,The evapotranspiration rate observed in the crop being studied.
ETo,The evapotranspiration rate observed for a well calibrated reference crop under the same conditions
Rainfall,Rainfall per day
Water_Need_1day,The water needs of the crop measured (Evapotranspiration (ETc) - Rainfall) times 4 aggregated every day.
Water_Need_2days,The water needs of the crop measured (Evapotranspiration (ETc) - Rainfall) times 4 aggregated every two days.
Water_Need_3days,The water needs of the crop measured (Evapotranspiration (ETc) - Rainfall) times 4 aggregated every three days.
