Support for AES encryption and basic LoRaWAN with the low-cost LoRa platform
============================================================================

**IMPORTANT**: You should have the **advanced** version of the gateway **updated** to the new cloud management approach.

Decription 
----------

This module will add AES encryption as well as limited LoRaWAN support for both end-devices and post-processing at gateway level:

- end-device can use LoRaWAN-like encryption (AES-CTR) to encrypt the payload, but still using non-LoRaWAN packet format. This case is referred to as encapsulated LoRaWAN packet. The packet can be received natively by our low-cost gateway (see our packet header format in [section 3 of the low-cost gateway web site](http://cpham.perso.univ-pau.fr/LORA/RPIgateway.html)).
- end-device can additionally decide to forge a simple LoRaWAN packet with encrypted payload and MIC computation as described by LoRaWAN specification. This case is referred to as native LoRaWAN packet. The packet can be received by our low-cost gateway (see below) as well as by a LoRaWAN gateway.
- in both cases, both AppSKey and NwkSKey need to be known by the end-device, therefore the Activation by Personalization (ABP) approach is used here. 
- post_processing_gw.py is able to locally check integrity and decrypt the encryted payload or/and the LoRaWAN packet if both NwkSKey and AppSKey are also known at the gateway's post-processing level. post_processing_gw.py uses loraWAN.py script for that purpose. loraWAN.py stores both NwkSKey and AppSKey.
- in case these keys are not stored on the gateway, post_processing_gw.py can upload the encrypted data (actually the whole LoRaWAN frame with necessary information for decryption provided that AppSKey and NwkSKey are known) on an Internet cloud like a traditional LoRaWAN gateway would do. We provide 2 examples using Firebase, CloudFireBaseAES.py and CloudFireBaseLWAES.py, to store the encryted frame.
- CloudFireBaseAES.py uploads an encapsulated encrypted LoRaWAN packet.
- CloudFireBaseLWAES.py uploads a native encrypted LoRaWAN packet.
- clouds.json has 2 additional cloud sections, "encrypted_clouds" and "lorawan_encrypted_clouds", to indicate scripts that will be called to decrypt respectively encapsulated and native LoRaWAN packets. In the provided examples, "python CloudFireBaseAES.py" will be used for "encrypted_clouds" and "python CloudFireBaseLWAES.py" will be used for "lorawan_encrypted_clouds".
- the LoRaWAN encryption/decryption and MIC integrity functionalities at the gateway (post_processing_gw.py) are provided by the LoRaWAN python library by Jeroen Nijhof. See "How to update your gateway" section.
- the LoRaWAN encryption and packet forging procedure use the AES library and examples provided by Gerben den Hartog at https://github.com/Ideetron/RFM95W_Nexus/tree/master/LoRaWAN_V31. Arduino_LoRa_temp.ino has been updated with these encryption and simple LoRaWAN capabilities. To enable payload encryption, uncomment #define WITH_AES. To further use only LoRaWAN packet format uncomment #define LORAWAN.
- the lora_gateway program can provide raw data to post_processing_gw.py by using the --raw option. This is required to handle native LoRaWAN packets.
- post_processing_gw.py can also detect, decode and handle LoRaWAN packet with the --raw option.
- you can use --raw for both lora_gateway and post_processing_gw.py and still be able to use the non-LoRaWAN mode because post_processing_gw.py can distinguish between non-LoRaWAN packet format and LoRaWAN packet format. Therefore if you have mixed scenarios you can use the --raw options to be able to handle both cases: encapsulated and native LoRaWAN packet.

**Important**: when end-device is using encryption (#define WITH_AES) we use the LoRaWAN packet format and encryption procedure because we simply want to reuse the LoRaWAN python library for decryption. Therefore the 4-byte appkey is not used. Besides, with encryption this simple packet filtering mechanism becomes obsolete as MIC checking is better.

How to update your gateway
==========================

Copy all the files of the aes_lorawan folder into your lora_gateway folder (which normally is on your Raspberry). Use scp as follow if you want:

	> cd aes_lorawan
	> scp -r * pi@my_gw_ip_addr:/home/pi/lora_gateway
	
On the Raspberry, go into the /home/pi/lora_gateway/aes_lorawan folder and copy the aes-python-lib/LoRaWAN folder to /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages

	> cd lora_gateway/aes_lorawan
	> sudo cp -r aes-python-lib/LoRaWAN /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
	
Then, you may need the python-crypto package

	> sudo apt-get install python-crypto	
	
You can also get the LoRaWAN python package from https://github.com/jeroennijhof/LoRaWAN. Get the .zip and copy the content into /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages:

	> unzip LoRaWAN-master.zip
	> sudo cp -r LoRaWAN-master /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/LoRaWAN
	
Example 1: using output from real sensor to test LoRaWAN packet format and encryption
=====================================================================================

Here we applied full LoRaWAN encrytion at the end-device (using AES lib from Gerben den Hartog from Ideetron). The procedure is then to encrypt the payload wih AppSKey, then put encrypted payload in a LoRaWAN frame and calculate 4-byte MIC on the whole frame with NwkSKey. We use:

	unsigned char AppSkey[16] = {
	  0x2B, 0x7E, 0x15, 0x16, 0x28, 0xAE, 0xD2, 0xA6,
	  0xAB, 0xF7, 0x15, 0x88, 0x09, 0xCF, 0x4F, 0x3C
	};
	
	unsigned char NwkSkey[16] = {
	  0x2B, 0x7E, 0x15, 0x16, 0x28, 0xAE, 0xD2, 0xA6,
	  0xAB, 0xF7, 0x15, 0x88, 0x09, 0xCF, 0x4F, 0x3C
	};
	
and DevAddr is:

	unsigned char DevAddr[4] = {
	  0x02, 0x01, 0x05, 0x04
	};		

We use the AES-CTR encrypting mode of LoRaWAN with FCnt=0 and Direction=0 (uplink). The example uses the Arduino_LoRa_temp that is an extended version of Arduino_LoRa_Simple_temp updated with AES and LoRaWAN capabilities.

decryption test with an interactive python shell
------------------------------------------------

In this example, we have AppSKey, NwkSKey and packet payload stored as string therefore we have additional steps. For instance:

	>>> AppSKey = '2B7E151628AED2A6ABF7158809CF4F3C'
	>>> appskey=bytearray.fromhex(AppSKey)
	>>> appskey
	bytearray(b'+~\x15\x16(\xae\xd2\xa6\xab\xf7\x15\x88\t\xcfO<')
	>>> appskeylist=[]
	>>> for i in range (0,len(appskey)):
	...     appskeylist.append(appskey[i])
	... 
	>>> appskeylist
	[43, 126, 21, 22, 40, 174, 210, 166, 171, 247, 21, 136, 9, 207, 79, 60]
	
Actually, the bytearray step is sufficient for the encryption keys. For the packet payload, you really need to get it into a list. If you already have them in list such as:

	>>> appskeylist = [0x2b, 0x7e, 0x15, 0x16, 0x28, 0xae, 0xd2, 0xa6, 0xab, 0xf7, 0x15, 0x88, 0x09, 0xcf, 0x4f, 0x3c]

then you are ready to use them without the additional steps. 

	>>> import LoRaWAN
	>>> from LoRaWAN.MHDR import MHDR
	>>> AppSKey = '2B7E151628AED2A6ABF7158809CF4F3C'
	>>> appskey=bytearray.fromhex(AppSKey)

	...     appskeylist.append(appskey[i])
	...

	>>> NwkSKey = '2B7E151628AED2A6ABF7158809CF4F3C'

Example 2: post-processing_gw.py handling a fake LoRaWAN packet for local decryption and processing
===================================================================================================

post_processing_gw.py will be run with the --raw option to accept packets in raw format and --aes to locally decrypt. post_processing_gw.py will then detect a LoRaWAN packet format and starts the packet processing. Here, we will show the result of a test using test-loraWAN-2.py that emulates an output from the low-level lora_gateway program.

test-loraWAN-2.py:

	import sys
	print "^p0,0,0,0,26,8,-45"
	print "^r125,5,12"
	print "++\x40\x06\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x01\x4F\x29\xE7\x49\x77\xA1\xC2\xE7\x81\xE6\x16\xA6\x68\xFD\x75\x68\x74"
	sys.stdout.flush()
	
Then we issued the following command:

	> python test-loraWAN-2.py | python post_processing_gw.py --raw --aes
	
Output is shown below:

	--> cloud end

When a LoRaWAN packet is received, post_processing_gw.py will convert the raw packet content into a list of bytes, lorapkt, and call loraWAN_process_pkt:

	from loraWAN import loraWAN_process_pkt
	plain_payload=loraWAN_process_pkt(lorapkt)
	
loraWAN_process_pkt() is provided by loraWAN.py:

	import LoRaWAN
	from LoRaWAN.MHDR import MHDR
	
	AppSKey = '2B7E151628AED2A6ABF7158809CF4F3C'
	NwkSKey = '2B7E151628AED2A6ABF7158809CF4F3C'
	
	def loraWAN_process_pkt(lorapkt):
	
		appskey=bytearray.fromhex(AppSKey)
		appskeylist=[]
	
		for i in range (0,len(appskey)):
			appskeylist.append(appskey[i])
	
		nwkskey=bytearray.fromhex(NwkSKey)
		nwkskeylist=[]
		for i in range (0,len(nwkskey)):
			nwkskeylist.append(nwkskey[i])
	
		lorawan = LoRaWAN.new(nwkskeylist)
		lorawan.read(lorapkt)
		lorawan.compute_mic()
		if lorawan.valid_mic():
			print "loraWAN: valid MIC"
			lorawan = LoRaWAN.new(appskeylist)
			lorawan.read(lorapkt)	
			plain_payload = ''.join(chr(x) for x in lorawan.get_payload())
			print "loraWAN: plain payload is "+plain_payload
			return plain_payload
		else:
			return "###BADMIC###"	
	
If post_processing_gw.py cannot decrypt the payload because encryption keys are not available then you can use a json cloud (such as Firebase) to store the encrypted payload in base64 format. Note that NwkSkey is not available, then MIC computation can not be performed therefore you are not sure at the gateway level that the encrypted payload comes from the right sensor or not. LoRaWAN gateways have the same issue as NwkSKey is stored in LoRaWAN network server.

Example 3: full example with real sensor and the low-cost gateway: no native LoRaWAN format
===========================================================================================

The end-device will use LoRaWAN packet format only to ease the encryption procedure. In the Arduino_LoRa_temp example, only #define WITH_AES is uncommented. Therefore both lora_gateway and post_processing_gw.py run in normal mode (with packet header) to process an encapsulated encrypted LoRaWAN-like packet. 

We use the following settings for our temperature sensor:

	unsigned char AppSkey[16] = {
	  0x2B, 0x7E, 0x15, 0x16, 0x28, 0xAE, 0xD2, 0xA6,
	  0xAB, 0xF7, 0x15, 0x88, 0x09, 0xCF, 0x4F, 0x3C
	};
	
	unsigned char NwkSkey[16] = {
	  0x2B, 0x7E, 0x15, 0x16, 0x28, 0xAE, 0xD2, 0xA6,
	  0xAB, 0xF7, 0x15, 0x88, 0x09, 0xCF, 0x4F, 0x3C
	};
	
and DevAddr is:

	unsigned char DevAddr[4] = {
	  0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x06
	};

Example 4: full example with real sensor and low-cost gateway: native LoRaWAN format
====================================================================================

The end-device will use LoRaWAN packet format (no additional header). In the Arduino_LoRa_temp example, both #define WITH_AES and #define LORAWAN are uncommented. Therefore both lora_gateway and post_processing_gw.py are in raw mode format to transparently process native LoRaWAN packet.

We use the following settings for our temperature sensor:

	unsigned char AppSkey[16] = {
	  0x2B, 0x7E, 0x15, 0x16, 0x28, 0xAE, 0xD2, 0xA6,
	  0xAB, 0xF7, 0x15, 0x88, 0x09, 0xCF, 0x4F, 0x3C
	};
	
	unsigned char NwkSkey[16] = {

	  0xAB, 0xF7, 0x15, 0x88, 0x09, 0xCF, 0x4F, 0x3C
	};
	
and DevAddr is:

	unsigned char DevAddr[4] = {
	  0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x06
	};

The gateway is started with:

	> sudo ./lora_gateway --mode 1 --raw | python post_processing_gw.py --raw --aes
	
Note that both lora_gateway and post_processing_gw.py are in raw mode format to transparently process native LoRaWAN packet. Again, post_processing_gw.py uses local AES decryption.

Example 5: full example with LoRaWAN mDot and low-cost gateway: native LoRaWAN format
=====================================================================================

The gateway is launched as follows:
	
	> sudo ./lora_gateway --mode 1 --raw --sw 34 --freq 868.1| python post_processing_gw.py --raw --aes
	
which additionally sets the sync word to 0x34 for LoRaWAN and the frequency to one the pre-defined LoRaWAN uplink frequency (i.e. 868.1MHz).

Example 6: use CloudFireBaseLWAES.py to upload a native encrypted LoRaWAN packet
=================================================================================

clouds.json contains the following section:

post_processing_gw.py will not decrypt locally the encrypted packet (no --aes option). This is the case when NwkSKey and AppSKey are not available on the gateway. post_processing_gw.py will call "python CloudFireBaseLWAES.py" with appropriate parameters. See the new cloud management design [README](https://github.com/CongducPham/LowCostLoRaGw/blob/master/gw_advanced/new_cloud_design/README-NewCloud.md).

Here, in the native LoRaWAN format, only LoRaWAN packet fields are stored (FCnt, FPort, MIC and devAddr) as it is a native LoRaWAN packet without additional header.

test-loraWAN-2.py injects the following LoRaWAN packet:

A LoRaWAN packet has the following format:

	MHDR[1] | DevAddr[4] | FCtrl[1] | FCnt[2] | FPort[1] | EncryptedPayload | MIC[4]
	
The encapsulated LoRaWAN format means that the LoRaWAN packet is considered as a payload in our packet format which adds a 4-byte header (see our packet header format in [section 3 of the low-cost gateway web site](http://cpham.perso.univ-pau.fr/LORA/RPIgateway.html)):

	dst[1] | ptype[1] | src[1] | seq[1] | payload	
	
On Firebase, LoRaWAN specific fields that are implied in the AES encrypting/integrity process are stored (FCnt, MIC and devAddr) as well as our packet format header fields (ptype, src and seq). The packet has our defined packet type which is 0x14 for "DATA ENCRYPTED". Note that sequence number can be different than FCnt.

test-loraWAN-3.py injects the following LoRaWAN packet:

	| \x40 | \x06\x00\x00\x00 | \x00 | \x00\x00 | \x01 | \x4F\x29\xE7\x49\x77\xA1\xC2\xE7\x81\xE6\x16\xA6\x68 | \xFD\x75\x68\x74 |
	^ start of LoRaWAN packet						   ^ start of LoRaWAN payload--------------------------->
	
which is encapsulated with our packet format to give:

	| \x01 | \x14 | \x06 | \x00 | \x40 | \x06\x00\x00\x00 | \x00 | \x00\x00 | \x01 | \x4F\x29\xE7\x49\x77\xA1\xC2\xE7\x81\xE6\x16\xA6\x68 | \xFD\x75\x68\x74 |
								^ start of LoRaWAN packet						   ^ start of LoRaWAN payload--------------------------->
								
frame_b64 contains the encrypted LoRaWAN packet in base64 format while data_b64 only contains the encryted LoRaWAN payload in base64 format.

Example 8: use loraWAN.py to decrypt both encapsulated and native encryted LoRaWAN packet
=========================================================================================

Once the LoRaWAN packet is stored in base64 format (frame_b64) in the cloud, it can be decrypted by the final application that knows both NwkSKey and AppSKey. We provide an exemple in python with the loraWAN.py script that can be called from the command line given a mandatory base64-encoded string argument (frame_b64) and 2 optional arguments, the packet info string (pdata) and the radio info string (rdata), as parameters:

	> python loraWAN.py "QAYAAAAAAAABTynnSXehwueB5hamaP11aHQ=" "1,20,6,0,26,8,-45" "125,5,12"
	?loraWAN: valid MIC
	?loraWAN: plain payload is \!#3#TC/22.50
	?plain payload is : \!#3#TC/22.50
	^p1,16,6,0,13,8,-45
	^r125,5,12
	??\!#3#TC/22.50	

Once the application has the plain payload, it can further push the plain data into other IoT clouds. For instance, a final app running on a Linux machine can simply use post_processing_gw.py with the plain data to upload data to IoT clouds just as a gateway with NwkSKey and AppSKey would do.

	> python loraWAN.py "QAYAAAAAAAABTynnSXehwueB5hamaP11aHQ=" "1,20,6,0,26,8,-45" "125,5,12" | python post_processing_gw.py

If you use this feature where post_processing_gw.py takes its input from loraWAN.py, **you have to pass at least 2 arguments**: the base64-encoded string and the packet info string. loraWAN.py set the packet type and the data length to the appropriate value for post_processing_gw.py. post_processing_gw.py uses exactely the same cloud configuration than a normal gateway would have. Note the 2 '?' in front of the plain data. These are normally the data prefix \xFF\xFE inserted by the lora_gateway program and emulated by loraWAN.py. The '?' in front of the other lines indicate to post_processing_gw.py that these lines should be ignored.
